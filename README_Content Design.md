# Turning Bank Data Into Web Content – Wiki Blog Web Design
## Aim
The aim of this part of the project is to take complex financial data and make it more understandable, engaging, and valuable for everyday people by transforming it into web-based content. Instead of just showing charts and numbers, this project focused on telling stories through a blog-style web page, where financial insights are shared in a simple, human-centered way.

By turning analysis into relatable content, the project also explores how data can be used in content marketing, online storytelling, and digital engagement through blogs, articles, and web design.

## How Bank Data Was Used for Content Creation
After analyzing the bank data in Excel, Python, and Power BI, the insights gathered—such as loan repayment patterns, spending peaks in certain months, and gaps in financial access—were turned into readable articles, news pieces, and digital content for a web page.

These insights were not just copied over. Instead, they were reshaped into short stories, advice articles, and case-style examples that a general audience could connect with.

### For example:

A spike in May spending led to an article on "Why People Spend More in Spring – and How to Plan for It".
Insights about loan defaults inspired a blog post on "Flexible Repayment Plans: What Struggling Borrowers Really Need".
Observations about freelancers’ financial struggles became the foundation of "The Credit Struggles of the Self-Employed".
These stories helped highlight real financial challenges while also offering support, suggestions, and thoughtful conversation.

## Tools Used
To bring the design and content together, several tools and platforms were used:

- Microsoft Excel and Power BI: For analyzing, cleaning, and visualizing the original banking data.
- WordPress/Web Builder (or HTML Design): To build and format the blog layout and sections.
- Canva / Figma: To create banners, thumbnails, and visual highlights for the web page.
- Google Keyword Planner / SEO tools: To find keywords and optimize blog titles and content for better visibility.
- Email Sign-Up Plugin: To allow users to subscribe to newsletters or updates from the blog.

## Storytelling Through Design and Content
Each section of the blog was built around a story or a pattern observed from the data:

- News headlines drew from current events shaped by financial stress or trends.
- Tips and suggestions were connected to seasonal financial behavior, like holiday overspending.
- Personal finance reflections focused on showing empathy and offering advice for readers facing debt or instability.
- Graphs and visuals were used sparingly—only when they helped support the story, not just to decorate the page.
- The content followed a friendly, inclusive tone, so that readers wouldn’t feel judged or overwhelmed, even when dealing with tough money topics.

## Color Themes and Visual Identity
The website used a neutral but warm palette, with soft blues, whites, and occasional highlights in green or orange:

- Blue tones to create a calm, professional feel for financial discussions.
- Green was used for sections that celebrated savings, success stories, or improvements.
- Orange and warm shades brought attention to challenges and support-focused content. The layout was simple and clean, with enough spacing, soft fonts, and clear headings to help users focus on the message.

## Content Marketing & Audience Strategy
- SEO and Blog Structure
- Blog posts were written using long-tail keywords, simple headlines, and structured formatting (subheadings, bullet points).
- Titles were crafted to sound like helpful advice or stories, not just technical articles.
- Every post had a meta description, tags, and internal links to related posts.

## Audience and Subscribers
- The blog was created for a wide audience, including students, working professionals, small business owners, and freelancers.
- A subscriber box was added to collect emails for updates, tips, and newsletters.
- Posts were scheduled weekly to maintain consistency and improve retention.

## Ad and CRM Integration
- Ad sections were placed thoughtfully between blog articles, avoiding spammy layouts.
- The design planned for future CRM integration, to allow personalized content or product recommendations based on reading behavior or sign-up interests.

## Support and User Engagement
To build trust and encourage repeat visits:

- A comment section was added under each article to allow readers to share their thoughts.
- A “Join Us” or “Get Involved” area offered ways to engage further—like submitting a story, asking a question, or joining a newsletter.
- The blog included a Contact and Support page, allowing users to get in touch for financial guidance, suggestions, or collaboration.

## Efforts and Workflow
This part of the project required several stages:

- Reading and interpreting banking and financial data from Power BI dashboards.
- Creating summaries, storylines, and advice posts based on those insights.
- Writing and editing the content to match a reader-friendly tone.
- Designing the blog layout, applying color themes, and organizing sections.
- Testing the readability, flow, and user experience of the web page.
- It took time to balance data accuracy with a storytelling approach, and special care was taken to avoid sounding too technical or vague.

## Limitations
- The original bank data did not include demographic info, so stories were generalized.
- The visual layout is designed manually and might not work on all screen sizes without adjustments.
- SEO and ad strategies are still in the early phase, and performance depends on ongoing testing and updates.
- The CRM and subscriber system are planned, but full automation is not yet in place.
