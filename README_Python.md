# Banking and Marketing Data Analysis
## Aim
The aim of this project is to understand how people manage their money by analyzing real banking data and exploring how marketing activities may influence financial behavior. It also provides hands-on practice with Excel and Python for working with data in a structured and meaningful way.

### Files Included
- bank.csv: This Excel-based file contains banking transaction data, including savings, loans, balances, and other personal financial activity.
- marketing analysis.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook used to explore and visualize the data using Python.

## Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel: First used to examine and understand the data, check for structure, and review contents manually before deeper analysis.
- Python (Jupyter Notebook): Used to clean, analyze, and visualize the data. Key Python libraries include:
  - pandas for reading and organizing the data
  - numpy for numeric calculations
  - matplotlib and seaborn for creating graphs and plots
    
## Effort and Workflow
The work began with reviewing the Excel data to see what kind of banking information was available. Several hours were spent formatting and preparing the file so that it could be used smoothly in Python. The notebook then walks through steps like checking missing values, filtering data, and drawing graphs to better understand what the data is showing.

Some additional effort was needed to connect banking behavior with marketing patterns, such as identifying seasonal changes or transaction peaks. The visuals were used to highlight findings and make the data easier to understand.

## Limitations
There were some limitations in the data and tools:

- The Excel file lacked background context, which made interpretation challenging in some areas.
- Some entries were inconsistent or unclear, which required manual fixing before continuing the analysis.
- Marketing analysis was limited to what could be inferred from transactions and patterns; no direct campaign or consumer data was available.

## How It Helps Stakeholders 
- This project works like a small case study for how data analysis can support better business understanding. For example, a marketing team could use this kind of analysis to see when people are most likely to spend or save money; helping them plan campaigns around key financial periods.

- Bank managers or product designers could also benefit by spotting trends in loan repayments or identifying user groups that need more flexible services.

- Storytelling through charts and written observations in the notebook makes the findings more relatable and actionable for non-technical stakeholders who just want to understand what's happening and why it matters.
